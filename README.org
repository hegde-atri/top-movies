#+title: Top Movies

A project to organize, rank and sort your watched movies. Give your movies a rating and a review. Quickly sort to find you favourite movies or shows. Simple search your movie, and the website will pull in all the relevant metadata for you!

For now I have not taken into account SEO, if you want to see my SEO skills, checkout my [[https://github.com/hegde-atri/hegdeatri-dot-com][personal website's repository]].
